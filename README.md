https://angular.io/guide/quickstart

## Array of expressions functions

Define expressions in index.html file.

Given there was not certinty where the functions would come from, I decided to leave them in the index to show how they were not deppendant on angular or any other component.


# Setup

## Requirements
Verify that you are running at least Node.js version 8.x or greater and npm version 5.x or greater

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Or run `ng serve --open` to open the browser automatically.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
